Notes:

1)  Selection Type Codes    1 = Proportional Selection
							2 = Tournament Selection
							3 = Random Selection

2)  Fitness Scaling Type    0 = Scale for Maximization (no change to raw fitness)
							1 = Scale for Minimization (reciprocal of raw fitness)
							2 = Rank for Maximization
							3 = Rank for Minimization
							4 = Sigma Scaling for Maximization

3)  Crossover Type Codes    1 = Single Point Crossover
							2 = Two Point Crossover
							3 = Uniform Crossover

4)  Crossover Rates from 0 to 1, Use "0" to turn off crossover

5)  Mutation Type Codes     1 = Flip Bit

6)  Mutation Rates from 0 to 1, Use "0" to turn off mutation

7)	Represents number of genes in each chromosome.

8)	Determines number of bits in each gene.  Number of Genes times Size
	gives the number of bits in each chromosome.

9) Determines if R1 or R2 will be used for evaluating Fitness	
	1 = R1
	2 = R2

10) Number of extra group evaluations to be completed

11) Percent of the initial population to only contain random building block. Between 0 and 1

12) Determines the size of the tournament for tournament selection.
    (Only used for Selection Type 2)

13) Determine the probability of selecting the best individual when performing
    tournament selection 1.0 = deterministic tournament selection meaning
    always select the best. (Only used for Selection Type 2)
