# EC_RoyalRoad


Implementation of Royal Road functions RR1 and RR2 as described by Forrest and Mitchell 1993. We are investigating the building-block hypothesis description of genetic algorithm behavior and how to design a genetic algorithm that most effectively takes advantage of its unique algorithmic features with the following questions:  

1. What selection method is best able to balance selecting parents with above average fitness and selecting parents with diverse building blocks?
2. How does the tournament size of tournament selection affect population diversity and GA performance?
3. By introducing an initial population that is biased to predefined building blocks, how is the population diversity and GA performance affected?
