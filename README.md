# EC_RoyalRoad


Implementation of Royal Road functions RR1 and RR2 as described by Forrest and Mitchell 1993. We are investigating the building-block hypothesis description of genetic algorithm behavior and how to design a genetic algorithm that most effectively takes advantage of its unique algorithmic features with the following questions:  

1. What selection method is best able to balance selecting parents with above average fitness and selecting parents with diverse building blocks?
2. What type of crossover is the most effective at combining building blocks, in the event that different building blocks exist on two parents?
